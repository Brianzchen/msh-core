# msh
Msh (My Shell) is a heavily customised shell built on top of zsh.

# Installation
0. Make sure zsh is installed. (If you want msh to work on top of other shells, feel free to port it yourself. If you want msh to work as a standalone shell, let me know because I've been thinking about that too.)
1. Clone the repository to your home directory (~/msh).
2. Put `. ~/msh/msh-core` into your .zshrc.
